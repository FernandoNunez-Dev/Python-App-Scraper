# Python-App-Scraper

## Project info

```
In a recent project, I found it necessary to collect bulk data from
different online sources in order to centralize it and make it easier 
for me to find and to make sense of. Unfortunetly some of those sources
didn't have public APIs. So I decided to code this module and try my hand 
at a little web crawling and scraping to obtain the metadata. Many people 
when faced with the same issue have turned towards Python.
